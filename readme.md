# pooch

the purpose of this webapp is to help with podium checks at etown college

this webapp is working :D

that being said, more progress to update/clean code, get better js, etc, is still underway

please check back for more updates

***Update***
as per etown's request, pooch will soon be moved over to a .NET c# webapp with MicrosoftSQL instead of mongodb.  the go/mongo version of this app will still be accessible, but will be placed in a seperate branch from master.  thank you
